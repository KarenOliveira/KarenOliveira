### About Me<br/>
Hi, I’m @KarenOliveira.

I hold a Bachelor of Science and Technology degree at UFABC (Federal University of ABC). I’ve been coding since 2015, starting with C++, and as I progressed through university, I became more comfortable with Java.

In 2018, I began my first professional experience in Software Development as an Intern. During this time, I worked with a tech stack that included Java, JavaScript, HTML, Git, SQL, ShellScript, JSP, Thymeleaf and CSS, focusing on Web Development. I stayed in this position for two years.

Afterward, I joined at my second company as an Intern and was later promoted to a full-time employee. In this role, I’ve worked on Big Data development, using Java, Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System), and Cloudera’s Hadoop Cluster.

In 2024, I proudly graduated at UFABC.

Currently, I’m revisiting some programming concepts and working on personal projects to build my portfolio for the next opportunity.
